 LEGAL ISSUES
 .
 In plain English:
 .
 1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs,
    please let us know!)
 2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us.
 3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a
    program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've
    used the IJG code.
 .
 In legalese:
 .
 The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
 with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
 fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
 its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
 .
 This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved
 except as specified below.
 .
 Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
 software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
 conditions:
 .
    (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then
        this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty
        notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the
        original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
    (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
        documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the
        work of the Independent JPEG Group".
    (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
        full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors
        accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
 .
 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
 not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to
 acknowledge us.
 .
 Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
 in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
 it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
 software".
 .
 We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
 commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
 assumed by the product vendor.
 .
 ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
 sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
 ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
 by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
 that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file
 ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
 of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
 the foregoing paragraphs do.
 .
 The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It
 is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The
 same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig,
 ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is
 also freely distributable.
 .
 It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
 patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot
 legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason,
 support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
 (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
 Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
 So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.
 .
 The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To
 avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been
 removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
 "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
 resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
 GIF decoders.
 .
 We are required to state that
 "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe
 Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

License: Qwt-1.0
                              Qwt License
                            Version 1.0, January 1, 2003
 .
 The Qwt library and included programs are provided under the terms
 of the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (LGPL) with the following
 exceptions:
 .
     1. Widgets that are subclassed from Qwt widgets do not
        constitute a derivative work.
 .
     2. Static linking of applications and widgets to the
        Qwt library does not constitute a derivative work
        and does not require the author to provide source
        code for the application or widget, use the shared
        Qwt libraries, or link their applications or
        widgets against a user-supplied version of Qwt.
 .
        If you link the application or widget to a modified
        version of Qwt, then the changes to Qwt must be
        provided under the terms of the LGPL in sections
        1, 2, and 4.
 .
     3. You do not have to provide a copy of the Qwt license
        with programs that are linked to the Qwt library, nor
        do you have to identify the Qwt license in your
        program or documentation as required by section 6
        of the LGPL.
 .
        However, programs must still identify their use of Qwt.
        The following example statement can be included in user
        documentation to satisfy this requirement:
 .
            [program/widget] is based in part on the work of
            the Qwt project (http://qwt.sf.net).

License: ANSI2KNR
 ansi2knr is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
 WARRANTY.  No author or distributor accepts responsibility to anyone for the
 consequences of using it or for whether it serves any particular purpose or
 works at all, unless he says so in writing.  Refer to the GNU General Public
 License (the "GPL") for full details.
 .
 Everyone is granted permission to copy, modify and redistribute ansi2knr,
 but only under the conditions described in the GPL.  A copy of this license
 is supposed to have been given to you along with ansi2knr so you can know
 your rights and responsibilities.  It should be in a file named COPYLEFT.
 [In the IJG distribution, the GPL appears below, not in a separate file.]
 Among other things, the copyright notice and this notice must be preserved
 on all copies.
 .
 We explicitly state here what we believe is already implied by the GPL: if
 the ansi2knr program is distributed as a separate set of sources and a
 separate executable file which are aggregated on a storage medium together
 with another program, this in itself does not bring the other program under
 the GPL, nor does the mere fact that such a program or the procedures for
 constructing it invoke the ansi2knr executable bring any other part of the
 program under the GPL.
 .
 ---------- Here is the GNU GPL file COPYLEFT, referred to above ----------

                     GHOSTSCRIPT GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                     (Clarified 11 Feb 1988)
 .
  Copyright (C) 1988 Richard M. Stallman
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
  license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also use this wording
  to make the terms for other programs.
 .
   The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the
 mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is
 intended to give everyone the right to share Ghostscript.  To make sure
 that you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make
 restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you
 to surrender the rights.  Hence this license agreement.
 .
   Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
 away copies of Ghostscript, that you receive source code or else can get
 it if you want it, that you can change Ghostscript or use pieces of it
 in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
 .
   To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
 deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
 copies of Ghostscript, you must give the recipients all the rights that
 you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 source code.  And you must tell them their rights.
 .
   Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds
 out that there is no warranty for Ghostscript.  If Ghostscript is
 modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know
 that what they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems
 introduced by others will not reflect on our reputation.
 .
   Therefore we (Richard M. Stallman and the Free Software Foundation,
 Inc.) make the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed
 to distribute or change Ghostscript.
 .
 .
                         COPYING POLICIES
 .
   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of Ghostscript source
 code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
 and appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright and license
 notice "Copyright (C) 1989 Aladdin Enterprises.  All rights reserved.
 Distributed by Free Software Foundation, Inc." (or with whatever year is
 appropriate); keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this
 License Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
 recipients of the Ghostscript program a copy of this License Agreement
 along with the program.  You may charge a distribution fee for the
 physical act of transferring a copy.
 .
   2. You may modify your copy or copies of Ghostscript or any portion of
 it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of
 Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:
 .
     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
     that you changed the files and the date of any change; and
 .
     b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,
     that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of Ghostscript
     or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third
     parties on terms identical to those contained in this License
     Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive
     warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).
 .
     c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
     transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
     protection in exchange for a fee.
 .
 Mere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or its
 derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
 the other program under the scope of these terms.
 .
   3. You may copy and distribute Ghostscript (or a portion or derivative
 of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the
 terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
 following:
 .
     a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
     Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
 .
     b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
     years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal
     shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the
     corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
     Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
 .
     c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
     corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
     received the program in object code or executable form alone.)
 .
 For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for
 all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include
 source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the
 operating system on which the executable file runs.
 .
   4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer Ghostscript
 except as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt
 otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer Ghostscript is
 void and your rights to use the program under this License agreement
 shall be automatically terminated.  However, parties who have received
 computer software programs from you with this License Agreement will not
 have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
 compliance.
 .
   5. If you wish to incorporate parts of Ghostscript into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the Free
 Software Foundation at 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.
 We have not yet worked out a simple rule that can be stated here, but we will often
 permit this.  We will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
 status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
 sharing and reuse of software.
 .
 Your comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our
 software are welcome!  Please contact the Free Software Foundation,
 Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA,
 or call (617) 876-3296.
 .
                        NO WARRANTY
 .
   BECAUSE GHOSTSCRIPT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY
 NO WARRANTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE STATE LAW.  EXCEPT
 WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC, RICHARD
 M. STALLMAN, ALADDIN ENTERPRISES, L. PETER DEUTSCH, AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
 PROVIDE GHOSTSCRIPT "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
 EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE
 ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF GHOSTSCRIPT IS WITH
 YOU.  SHOULD GHOSTSCRIPT PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
 NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL RICHARD M.
 STALLMAN, THE FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC., L. PETER DEUTSCH, ALADDIN
 ENTERPRISES, AND/OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE
 GHOSTSCRIPT AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
 ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
 (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
 INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
 PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS) GHOSTSCRIPT, EVEN IF YOU
 HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM
 BY ANY OTHER PARTY.

 of such sublicense. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in
 effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
 .
 5. No Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use

 statutory, which under any applicable law it might be deemed to have
 been distributed.
 .
 8. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any
 one or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use,
 distribution, import or sale of Subject Software (including particular
 functionality or code incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the
 third party's intellectual property rights, Recipient must place in a
 well-identified web page bearing the title "LEGAL" a description of each
 such claim and a description of the party making each such claim in
 sufficient detail that a user of the Subject Software will know whom to
 contact regarding the claim. Also, upon gaining such knowledge of any
 such claim, Recipient must conspicuously include the URL for such web
 page in the Exhibit A notice required under Sections 2 and 3, above, and
 in the text of any related documentation, license agreement or
 collateral in which Recipient describes end user's rights relating to
 the Subject Software. If Recipient obtains such knowledge after it makes
 Subject Software available to any other person or entity, Recipient
 shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
 newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
 Subject Software that new knowledge has been obtained.
 .
 9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"

 BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
 DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER

 LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY
 OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
 LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE
 TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
 JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
 RECIPIENT.
 .
 11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages
 arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under
 this License. Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon
 Graphics, Inc. from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or
 expenses (including the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising
 out of Recipient's use, modification, reproduction and distribution of

       conditions of this License by undertaking any of the aforementioned
       actions. The patent license shall apply to the Covered Code if, at the
       time any related Modification is added, such addition of the
       Modification causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
       Patents. The patent license in Section 2.1(ii) shall not apply to any
       other combinations that include the Modification. No patent license is
       provided under SGI Patents for infringements of SGI Patents by

       2.1 and 2.2 are not applicable to implementation in Hardware of the
       algorithms embodied in the Original Code or any Modifications provided
       by SGI .
 .
 3.    Redistributions.
 .
 3.1.  Retention of Notice/Copy of License. The Notice set forth in Exhibit A,
       below, must be conspicuously retained or included in any and all
       redistributions of Covered Code. For distributions of the Covered Code
       in source code form, the Notice must appear in every file that can
       include a text comments field; in executable form, the Notice and a copy
       of this License must appear in related documentation or collateral where
       the Recipient's rights relating to Covered Code are described. Any
       Additional Notice Provisions which actually appears in the Original Code
       must also be retained or included in any and all redistributions of
       Covered Code.
 .
 3.2.  Alternative License. Provided that Recipient is in compliance with the
       terms of this License, Recipient may, so long as without derogation of
       any of SGI's rights in and to the Original Code, distribute the source
       code and/or executable version(s) of Covered Code under (1) this License;
       (2) a license identical to this License but for only such changes as are
       necessary in order to clarify Recipient's role as licensor of
       Modifications; and/or (3) a license of Recipient's choosing, containing
       terms different from this License, provided that the license terms
       include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 13, which terms
       may not be modified or superseded by any other terms of such license. If
       Recipient elects to use any license other than this License, Recipient
       must make it absolutely clear that any of its terms which differ from
       this License are offered by Recipient alone, and not by SGI. It is
       emphasized that this License is a limited license, and, regardless of
       the license form employed by Recipient in accordance with this Section
       3.2, Recipient may relicense only such rights, in Original Code and
       Modifications by SGI, as it has actually been granted by SGI in this
       License.
 .
 3.3.  Indemnity. Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability
       incurred by SGI as a result of any such alternative license terms
       Recipient offers.
 .
 4.    Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
       terminate automatically if Recipient breaches any term herein and fails
       to cure such breach within 30 days thereof. Any sublicense to the
       Covered Code that is properly granted shall survive any termination of
       this License, absent termination by the terms of such sublicense.
       Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
       termination of this License, shall survive.
 .
 5.    No Trademark Or Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights to:
       (i) any software apart from the Covered Code, nor shall any other rights
       or licenses not expressly granted hereunder arise by implication,
       estoppel or otherwise with respect to the Covered Code; (ii) any trade
       name, trademark or service mark whatsoever, including without limitation
       any related right for purposes of endorsement or promotion of products
       derived from the Covered Code, without prior written permission of SGI;
       or (iii) any title to or ownership of the Original Code, which shall at
       all times remains with SGI. All rights in the Original Code not
       expressly granted under this License are reserved.
 .
 6.    Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. There are various worldwide laws,
       regulations, and executive orders applicable to dispositions of Covered
       Code, including without limitation export, re-export, and import control
       laws, regulations, and executive orders, of the U.S. government and other
       countries, and Recipient is reminded it is obliged to obey such laws,
       regulations, and executive orders. Recipient may not distribute Covered
       Code that (i) in any way infringes (directly or contributorily) any
       intellectual property rights of any kind of any other person or entity
       or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express, implied or
       statutory, to which, under any applicable law, it might be deemed to
       have been subject.
 .
 7.    Claims of Infringement. If Recipient learns of any third party claim
       that any disposition of Covered Code and/or functionality wholly or
       partially infringes the third party's intellectual property rights,
       Recipient will promptly notify SGI of such claim.
 .
 8.    Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of
       the License from time to time, each with a distinguishing version number.
       Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
       License, Recipient may, for the duration of the license, continue to use

 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
 3.1. Application of License.
 .
 The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
 by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The
 Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms
 of this License or a future version of this License released under Section
 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
 Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
 Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
 License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
 additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
 .
 3.2. Availability of Source Code.
 .
 Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
 available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the
 same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
 Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
 available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
 must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
 initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
 version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
 recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
 remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
 maintained by a third party.
 .
 3.3. Description of Modifications.
 .
 You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
 documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date
 of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification
 is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the
 Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in
 (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or
 related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
 Covered Code.
 .
 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
 .
 (a) Third Party Claims.
 .
 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
 intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by
 such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text
 file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the
 claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
 will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
 Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor
 shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes
 available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
 appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform
 those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
 .
 (b) Contributor APIs.
 .
 If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface
 and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably
 necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this
 information in the LEGAL file.
 .
 (c) Representations.
 .
 Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
 above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
 Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
 to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
 .
 3.5. Required Notices.
 .
 You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.
 If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file
 due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such
 as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a
 notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as
 a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate
 this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe
 recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may
 choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
 liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,
 You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
 Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any
 such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
 alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
 Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
 Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
 You offer.
 .
 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
 .
 You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements
 of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include
 a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is
 available under the terms of this License, including a description of how
 and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must
 be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
 documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating
 to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
 Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain
 terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with
 the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version
 does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
 version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
 Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely
 clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,
 not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
 indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
 incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
 such terms You offer.
 .
 3.7. Larger Works.
 .
 You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
 governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
 single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
 License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
 with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
 order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
 License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
 the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
 described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the
 Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
 description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill
 to be able to understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
 This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
 notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
 6.1. New Versions.
 .
 Inprise Corporation (''Inprise'') may publish revised and/or new versions of
 the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
 version number.
 .
 6.2. Effect of New Versions.
 .
 Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
 License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version.
 You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any
 subsequent version of the License published by Inprise. No one other than
 Inprise has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
 under this License.
 .
 6.3. Derivative Works.
 .
 If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only
 do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed
 by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases
 ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL", ''NPL",
 "InterBase", "Inprise", "Borland'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not
 appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this
 License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
 contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape
 Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original
 Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
 themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
 .
 6.4 Origin of the InterBase Public License.
 .
 The InterBase public license is based on the Mozilla Public License V 1.1
 with the following changes:
 .
 1. The license is published by Inprise Corporation. Only Inprise Corporation
 can modify the terms applicable to Covered Code.
 2. The license can be modified and used for code which is not already
 governed by this license. Modified versions of the license must be renamed
 to avoid confusion with Netscape?s or Inprise?s license and must include a
 description of changes from the InterBase Public License.
 3. The name of the license in Exhibit A is the "InterBase Public License".
 4. The reference to an alternative license in Exhibit A has been removed.
 5. Amendments I, II, III, V, and VI have been deleted.
 6. Exhibit A, Netscape Public License has been deleted
 7. A new amendment (II) has been added, describing the required and
 restricted rights to use the trademarks of Inprise Corporation.
 .
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
 COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
 WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
 MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE
 RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
 SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
 DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
 SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
 ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
 HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8. TERMINATION.
 .
 8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
 breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to
 the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination
 of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
 beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
 .
 8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
 (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
 Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such
 action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:
 .
 (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
 any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
 Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
 Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt
 of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
 agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications
 made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect
 to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of
 notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed
 upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the
 rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period
 specified above.
 .
 (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
 Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
 rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b)
 are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed,
 or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.
 .
 8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
 that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
 any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
 prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
 reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections
 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of
 any payment or license.
 .
 8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end
 user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
 been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
 shall survive termination.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
 NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
 OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
 ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE
 OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF
 SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
 PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
 APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
 The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48
 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and
 ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48
 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
 acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
 .
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
 This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
 hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
 provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
 enforceable. This License shall be governed by Georgia law provisions (except
 to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
 conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
 party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business
 in the United States of America, Any litigation relating to this License
 shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
 District of Georgia and/or the state courts of Gwinnett County, Georgia,
 with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,
 court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of
 the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
 Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the
 language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
 apply to this License.
 .
 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
 As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
 for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
 utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
 Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
 basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
 admission of liability.
 .
 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
 .
 Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
 "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer
 permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of
 the InterBase Public License or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
 by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
 .
